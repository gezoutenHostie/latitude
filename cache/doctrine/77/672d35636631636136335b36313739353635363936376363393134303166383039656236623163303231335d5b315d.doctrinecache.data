                <h2>About us</h2>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong>
Two brothers Corey &amp; Rick Billington, along with long time friend Bradley Townsend, founded Latitude Blockchain Services Pty Ltd in October 2017 in South East Queensland, Australia. </p>
<p>"Our ideas for starting, and forming the company started flowing when we could clearly see that there were many companies struggling to find quality services. Valuable time was wasted sourcing things from multiple providers, and often it was hit and miss with quality.  That was the feedback we were getting from company team members. We could see the desperate need for a central hub with all these services under one banner, and how beneficial it would be to bring them all together under one roof to increase productivity and to relieve stress from the new Blockchain companyâ€™s team, enabling them to shift their focus on progression of their vision". </p>
<p>Born out of a love for the crypto community and Blockchain technology, coupled with the immense possibilities that this company could provide, we feel that we're able to provide a helping hand and straight-forward path to success for projects that we share a vision with.  </p>
<p>And thus the name Latitude Blockchain Services Pty Ltd came about! After about a week of scribbling ideas onto a whiteboard, we eventually found a name that encompassed our core functionality: global coverage and Blockchain specialised multifaceted services. </p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The vision for Latitude Blockchain Services is anchored around providing an all-in-one, full-scale service to relieve some of the stress that all blockchain start-ups experience.  We plan to continuously grow our extensive network and strategic partnerships to ensure we can provide a broad range of services, leveraging those who influence the industry.</em></p>
